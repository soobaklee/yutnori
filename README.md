YUTNORI broken down refers to play (nori) of the yut sticks. It is a game played by young and old alike and is usually most often played during national South Korean holidays. The game consists of tossing 4 sticks shaped like half moons. The players toss the 4 sticks in the air and each combination of sticks landing represent the number of points the players receive. The points are then used to move the players' life pieces around the circular or rectangle board and whichever player circles the board 3 times first, wins the game.

This rendition of the gameboard differs from the original and much loved gameboard. Normally, the gameboard is now shaped like a rectangle with an 'X' that crosses through the middle extending from the four corners. In the original game, the players are also able to decide on the route they wish to take their pieces. The different routes help players avoid being run into by their opponents

### Directions to Play
Player 1 begins this rendered game version by 'tossing' sticks by using the red button bottom of the screen. Once the sticks are tossed and landed, the player can move their life piece 'x' number of spaces. If the player tosses a back doh on the first toss, this has no affect on the player. If the player tosses a yut or moh, the player then rolls a second or third or fourth, etc time.

If player 1 and player 2 happen to land on the same spot, the previous player's life returns back to 0. 
Once a player's piece travels around the board completely, the player has earned a life. Traditionally, 3 lives traveled indicates the winner. The players are notified of the most recent life earned at the bottom of the screen.

At the end of the game, the winner has traveled around 3 times and is able to play again if desired.

As mentioned, this rendition of the game does not reflect aspects of the game and as such creating the 'X' through the middle of the gameboard is an ice-box item to be addressed in the future.
Once the gameboard has been updated, the game toss video and player buttons will need to be rearranged.
